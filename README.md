INFO498 Final Project

## What is it?

In our INFO 498 (Android App Development) class, our final project is to create a working application of our choosing. We decided to help the homebrewing community by developing an application that will assist the brewing process, which at time can be fairly tedious.

We decided to leverage the API provided by Malt.io (api.malt.io), due to its large amount of features, and existing community base.
